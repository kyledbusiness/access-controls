# What Are Access Controls?

Access controls are how we decide **who can access what** in a system.

They help protect data by making sure only the right people can:
- Sign in
- View certain files or apps
- Make changes to systems

---

## Why Access Controls Matter

Without access controls, anyone could get into anything, leading to:
- Data leaks
- Unauthorized changes
- Security and compliance issues

---

## Types of Access Controls

- **Role-based access:** Access is based on your job (e.g. HR, IT, Finance).
- **Attribute-based access:** Rules use things like location, time, or device.
- **Discretionary access:** The owner decides who gets access.
- **Mandatory access:** Strict rules set by the system (common in government or military).

## Key Ideas to Know

- **Authentication:** Proving who you are (like entering a password or using MFA)
- **Authorization:** Deciding what youâ€™re allowed to do
- **Least privilege:** Only giving people the access they actually need
- **Audit logs:** Keeping track of who accessed what, and when

## Real-World Examples

- Only managers can approve vacation requests  
- You need MFA to log into your work email  
- Engineers can access test servers but not production

## Where Access Controls Fit in IAM

Access controls are a big part of Identity and Access Management (IAM).  
Tools like **Entra ID**, **Okta**, and **CyberArk** use them to protect systems and keep users safe.

---

**In short:** Access controls help keep systems safe by making sure the right people have the right access and no more than that.
